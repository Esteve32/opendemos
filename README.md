# opendemos
Various project demos in browsers (html, etc..)

## Usage

Visit `index.html` to see all available project demos with clickable links.

## Automation

The `index.html` file is automatically generated using the Node.js script:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This script scans the `projects/` directory for HTML files and creates an index page with clickable links to each project.
